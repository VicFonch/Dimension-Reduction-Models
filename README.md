# Dimension-Reduction-Models

In this notebook, dimension reduction methods are applied to data from the IMM in Mexico, with the aim of creating informative and interactive graphs about the data. Apart from this, a SOM was applied to find clusters in the data. The methods applied were:

1. Linear Local Embedding

2. PCA

3. Isomaps

4. T-SNE

5. SOM

As a recomendation, its better that download or copy the code, for apretiate the interactive graphics, because here in github you can't see them
